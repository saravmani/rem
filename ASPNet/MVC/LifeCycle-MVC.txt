 if the request is the first request the first thing is to fill the route table with routes collection. 
This filling of route table happens in the global.asax file.


MVC requests are mapped to route tables which in turn specify which controller and action to be invoked.

Depending on the URL sent “UrlRoutingModule” searches the route table to create “RouteData” object which has the details of which controller and action to invoke.


The “RouteData” object is used to create the “RequestContext” object.


This request object is sent to “MvcHandler” instance to create the controller class instance. Once the controller class object is created it calls the “Execute” method of the controller class.
