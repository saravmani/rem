Difference btn addin module sections under
system.web vs system.weserver
------------------------------------------------
The system.web section is for configuring IIS 6.0, while the system.webserver version is used to configure IIS 7.0. IIS 7.0 includes a new ASP.NET pipeline and some configuration differences, hence the extra config sections.
If you're running IIS 7.0 in integrated mode only, you shouldn't need to add the handlers to both sections. Adding it to system.web as well is a fallback for IIS 7.0 operating in classic mode, 


The system.webServer section in the Web.config file specifies settings for IIS 7.0 that are applied to the Web application. The system.WebServer is a child of the configuration section. 

Some settings in the system.webServer section apply only to IIS 7.0 Integrated mode and do not apply to Classic mode

 In particular, any managed-code modules and handlers specified in the system.WebServer section of the Web.config file are ignored if the application is running in Classic mode. Instead, the managed-code modules and handlers must be defined as in earlier versions of IIS,
