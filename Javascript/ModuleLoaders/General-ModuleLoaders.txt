CommonJS, AMD, ES2015 are specifications.
CommonJS vs AMD vs ES2015



CommonJS modules were designed with server development in mind. Naturally, the API is synchronous. In other words, modules are loaded at the moment and in the order they are required inside a source file.
System.js: a universal module loader that supports CommonJS, AMD and ES2015 modules.


Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
AMD was born out of a group of developers that were displeased with the direction adopted by CommonJS. In fact, AMD was split from CommonJS early in its development. The main difference between AMD and CommonJS lies in its support for asynchronous module loading.


ES2015 Modules

Fortunately, the ECMA team behind the standardization of JavaScript decided to tackle the issue of modules. The result can be seen in the latest release of the JavaScript standard: ECMAScript 2015 (previously known as ECMAScript 6). The result is syntactically pleasing and compatible with both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation.


CommonJS is a specificaiton.
CommonJS is used in NodeJS to require modules at build time. 
CommonJS specification defines how modules in JavaScript work , how they can be exposed and how they can be called. 
E.g. the modules are compiled and are then delivered to the browser with all code loaded up front.


SystemJs is module loader. it is open source
SystemJS however replaces requireJS. SystemJS loads modules dynamically at run time.
In Angular2 if you watch your browser's NET tab you will see SystemJS loading files as you
explore more parts of you app.


CommonJS specification defines how modules in JavaScript work , how they can be exposed and how they can be called. SystemJS is a loader which follows CommonJS specs and other specs.



During the alpha stage of Angular, the Angular bundles where initially published in SystemJs format, 
but now they are published in CommonJs (see here).


Advantages of Commonjs module format
-----------------------------------------
CommonJs is easily consumable by existing popular tools such as Browserify or Webpack
CommonJs can also be easily consumed by SystemJs
CommonJs is the node.js module format, which allows for components to be more simply used in server-side rendering
the size of CommonJs bundles is smaller (in the case of Angular the gain was around 20%)
