By default, the following headers are sent when an XHR request is sent:
Accept � The content types that the browser can handle.
Accept-Charset � The character sets that the browser can display.
Accept-Encoding � The compression encodings handled by the browser.
Accept-Language � The languages the browser is running in.
Connection � The type of connection the browser is making with the server.
Cookie � Any cookies set on the page.
Host � The domain of the page making the request.
Referer � The URI of the page making the request. Note that this header is spelled incorrectly
in the HTTP specifi cation and so must be spelled incorrectly for compatibility purposes.
(The correct spelling of this word is �referrer�.)
User-Agent � The browser�s user-agent string.

content-length - To speed up responses, the Content-Length field should be sent with your response
when possible


Setting the Content-Length header implicitly disables chunked encoding, providing a performance boost because less data needs to be transferred.
for small content of data we can disable content-length property.
: for streaming media, it's pointless to use output buffering or response size; for large files, output buffering doesn't make sense, but Content-Length and byte
 serving makes a lot of sense
  (restarting a failed download is possible).
   if the content length is really unpredictable beforehand (e.g. when your intent is to zip several files together and send it as one), then sending it in chunks may be faster than buffering it in server's memory or writing to local disk file system first. But this indeed impacts the user experience negatively because the download progress is unknown. The impatient may then abort the download and move along.
Another benefit of knowing the content length beforehand is the ability to resume downloads

Content-Length value should represent the byte length, not character length
