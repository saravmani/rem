DOcker installation
------------------------
to install docker on windows 10 it needs hyper-v enabled.
but windows 10 home edition not having hyper-v option. so we need to update windows home edition to windows 10 professionald


Ddocer is open
container
docker
----------

isolated environment. application will have all the items within this container


visual studio tools docker -> this tool we can install on vsts , so that using vsts 2015 we can 
install our app in docker


 Vagrant -- ## dont know what is vagrant


 we can create docker image and it will build the environment

 docker image has complete environment to run the application

 ex: if it is a node js application then docker image has
 application
 nodejs
 ....

 if we deboy this image in any machine, that machine no nned to 
 have node js into it. bcs docuker image has this node js
