The common language runtime (CLR) can either run garbage collection concurrently on a separate thread or on the same thread as the application.
 Use the <gcConcurrent> element to specify how the runtime should run garbage collection. The following shows to disable concurrent garbage collection.

<configuration>
   <runtime>
       <gcConcurrent enabled="false"/>
   </runtime>
</configuration>

By default, the runtime runs garbage collection concurrently, which reduces performance. If your application is single-threaded and involves heavy user interaction, 
leave concurrent garbage collection enabled so the application does not pause to perform garbage collection. If your application is an ASP.NET server application, 
you do not need to alter the default value of the <gcConcurrent> element.
