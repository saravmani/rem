OAuth is a protocol that allows end users to give access to third party applications to access their resources stored on a server

OAuth Vs OpenID
----------------------
OAuth and OpenId both are authentication protocol

In OAuth we can make user to authenticate and also we can able to controll their access on resources.
But in OpeId we can't controll the access

In simple words 
OAuth = Authentication+Autherisation
OpenId = Authentication
